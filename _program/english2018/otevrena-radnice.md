*We'll turn Prague into the most transparent city in the country. 
Today our capital is facing an issue of completely untransparent city companies
 managing tens of billions of CZK a year. Citizens as well as anti-corruption 
activists must have an anccess to the necessary amount of information so that 
they could check what the politicians are doing. We will bring citizens to 
the the process of decisionmaking in the city.*

### Everyting will be published
* **We will show the data to general public** Lists of invoices, rent contracts, analyses the
city ordered â€“ this and even more will come to the Open Data portal.
* **Clickable budget will be extended up to the invoice level** Everyone will get a
clear idea about what the local authority spends money on.
* **Property statements of the politicians will go public**. Everyone will have a
chance to figure out if some politicians are hiding any benefits that were obtained in an illegal fasion.

### Responsible economy
* **Bad contracts for commercial spaces in central Prague must go.** The local
authority is loosing tens of millions of CZK yearly only on these. All upcoming
rental offers will be announced on commercial websites, so more bidders will 
have their chance to offer a better price for the city. 
* **Beter competition for public contracts** With open procurment process,
better terms and reasonable demands for the suppliers, we will allow other
companies to participate in the whole procurement proces. This will help us
to get better prices as well as better quality of service. 
* **Personal responsibility for bureaucracy workers and politicians. Transparent administrative processes.**
Project management will be reorganized in the city administration in such a fashion
that it will be very clear for every step who is the responsible person. The City
Council voting records will include data on every of its member. 

### Functioning city companies
* **No more political placement**. Those who run the city companies will be
chosen by a transparent fasion. All these people in charge will have to show
that their work is valid and real. 
* **A plan for city companies ownership policy**. People in charge of city
companies will be rewieved and rewarded according to their ability to fulfill
the goals and metrics defined earlier. 
* **More transparency for companies managing huge amounts of money.** Some of
them have budges in tens of billions of CZK. We will make sure that these will
publish all necessary information that can't be considered as business secret.
No more contracts that will be omitted from public registries.

### Participation of citizens on decisionmaking process
* **Citizen initiatives' agenda**. Initiatives by the citizens won't be left without and anwser.
Public management of this agenda will allow everyone to see how these initiatives are being adressed. 
Major submissions will be also parts of the sessions of the committees of City Assembly or Council or
the Assembly itself. 
* **Surveys** Surveys and questionnares will help to analyze real needs of the citizens.
* **Public debates** These will be arranged for current issues or further plans
of the local authorities. Both ordinary citizens as well as experts will have a 
chance to participate.
* **Participatory budgeting** Some part of the funds of the city will be used for
projects directly initiated by its citizens.
