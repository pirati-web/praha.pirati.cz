* We will support culture and events initiated by and for the community, without the usual red tape. As Pirates we value our cultural heritage. Renovation over demolition.*

### Community culture and public space activities
* **Support cultural and neighborhood-related events orchestrated by the community**.
Simplify the bureaucracy that currently goes with the use of a public space for a limited time. Small community-related events will get our support. 
* **Public spaces will be cultivated with art installations**.
Existing sculptures and other works of art in public space will be documented, as well as renovated and maintained. 

### Transparent finance management for culture
* **Financial management of cultural institutions has to be transparent**. We will reduce their dependence on political power, so that organizations and their structures are not infiltrated and influenced from within.
* **Grant proposals accepted at least twice a year**. We will
cancel the distribution of grants outside of grant terms. Prevent applicants from bypassing grant committees.

### Architecture and sites protection
* **Architecture and urbanism contests** need to become an obligatory standard for new
projects. The total cost of a project ought not be the major criterion. 
* **Preservation over demolition**. Initiate a new urbanism and architecture
contest for the Výstaviště Exhibition Grounds area. Rebuild the damaged wing of the Industrial Palace, the core of the area destroyed in a fire in 2008.

### Healthy development of tourism
* **No more tourist traps**. A shameful reality confirmed by
many a foreign visitor. We will get rid of the rogue money exchange, taxi services and
others taking advantage of people who are not familiar with the capital. 
* **The city centre is not just for tourists**. Support inner-city community life and take measures against certain tourist behaviour patterns that are detrimental to the local quality of life and work.
