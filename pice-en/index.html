    <p>The new Pirate centre Prague (PiCe Praha) opened in autumn 2018 as a contact point for public supporters of the Pirate party. The venue has been hosting public workshops, courses, lectures, seminars, presentations and screenings. Further agenda of the PiCe Praha can be found in the Google Calendar and includes local community events, regular board meetings and election campaign committee meetings. The offices of three Pirate members of Parliament (Ondřej Profant, František Kopřiva and Jakub Michálek) are also located in the same building.</p>
